## Installation
You need GNU Stow to actually place everything where it needs to be. Just
install it on your system and run `stow <CONFIG>` to place `CONFIG`'s files
where they need to be. For example, `stow emacs` would place the emacs config
in the proper place.

If you want everything to be placed in its proper place, just `stow *`.
